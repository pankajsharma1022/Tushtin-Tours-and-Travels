        <p>Polo and hockey are popular sports here. Manipur has also given birth to Manipuri, a local style of classical dance. Unlike other dance forms of India, this dance form uses hand postures rather than silent performances, the accents cannot be produced by the ghungroos, and the dancers and dancers perform this dance together. Dance plays, which are interpreted by the narrator, form an important part of the religious life here. The themes of these plays are generally taken from the life of Krishna, the animal husbandry deity of Hinduism. This dance, almost unknown for a long time, was introduced to the rest of India by the great poet Rabindranath Tagore in 1917. Raas, sankirtana dance and thang-ta (mridang playing) are also important parts of their cultural life. Apart from this, Manipuris are good warriors and practice wrestling, fencing and martial arts. They also play polo.
