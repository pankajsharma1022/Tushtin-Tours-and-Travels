        <p>There are many temples, forts and caves in Madhya Pradesh, which provide exciting evidence from the point of view of both the past history of the region and the historical study of both the local dynasties and states. One of the earliest monuments here is Bharhut's Stupa (about 175 BC) near Satna, the remains of which are now kept in the National Museum in Kolkata. One such monument, the Stupa at Sanchi (about 13 km south-west of Vidisha), was originally built from 265 to 238 BC. It was built by Emperor Ashoka in Later Shunga kings got more work done in this stupa. The Bagh Caves near Mhow, decorated with paintings on Buddhist themes, are particularly noteworthy. The Udayagiri caves (Buddhist and Jain monasteries) near Vidisha represent examples of rock-cut architecture and art.

            fame
            The temples of Khajuraho, world famous for the aesthetic arts, are located in the north of the state in Chhatarpur district; These temples, which started to be built from 1000 AD, were built by the Chandela kings. The temples in and around Gwalior are also noteworthy. The palaces and mosques of Mandu (near Dhar), the marvelous fort of Bandhavgarh built in the 14th century and perhaps the most magnificent of the residences of former virgins of Madhya Pradesh, Gwalior Fort are other notable examples representing architectural achievements. Although the people of Madhya Pradesh have more or less embraced external influences, many of their tribal traditions remain alive and strong, and a large number of tribal myths and folktales have been preserved. The chiefs (Bhats of the Gonds) still sing the legendary heroic tales of the legendary Adi Purush Lingo-pen of the Gond tribe. The Gond equivalent of the Mahabharata is the Pandavani, while the Gond equivalent of the Ramayana is the Lachmanjati legend. Each tribe has its own myths and legends regarding its origin. They have their own birthday and wedding songs, and various dance styles are accompanied by their songs. Folktales, riddles and folktales characterize their cultural heritage.
            cultural programme
            The state hosts several well-known cultural events every year, such as the Kalidas Samaroh (for performing arts and fine arts) in Ujjain, the Tansen Samaroh (singing) in Gwalior and the Khajuraho dance festival, which is attended by artists from across India. Bharat Bhavan is a unique cultural building in Bhopal, which serves as a meeting place for artists from different fields. Situated near Bhopal Tal, this building houses a museum, a library, a Muktakashi Theater and several conference complexes. Important annual religious fairs are held at Mandsaur and Ujjain.</p>
