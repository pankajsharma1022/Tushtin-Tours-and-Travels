Be it a tribal festival or a mango, the zeal and fervor with which the festivals of Tripura are celebrated is unparalleled by both tribal tribes and non-tribal groups.<br><br>

<b>Khaki Puja</b> It is one of the most important festivals of Tripura and is basically celebrated with equal joy and enthusiasm by tribal and non-tribal groups. The word 'Khaya' signifies the earth, hence the festival of Kharchi Puja means the worship of the earth, which sustains life with all its resources. It is celebrated in the region of Agartala in the month of July. Utsav celebrations spread over a period of seven days and mainly take place in the temple premises. Thousands of devotees participate in this festival to make it a grand success.<br><br>

<b>Ashokashtami</b> It is one of the most auspicious festivals of Tripura and is celebrated with much fervor and enthusiasm every year in the months of March/April at Unakoti Teerth in Kailashahar sub-division of the state. Religious customs are followed by the local people and the festival achieves equal state of happiness in the hearts of both tribals and non-tribals. Many rock-cut images of local deities can be seen on the walls of Unakoti hill and are worshiped with great devotion by thousands of devotees. The ritual of taking a holy dip in the Ashtami Kund is marked as a special feature of this festival.<br><br>

<b>Diwali</b> It is celebrated with great enthusiasm in Tripura and is one of the most important festivals of Tripura. It is celebrated every year in the month of October/November with great enthusiasm and enthusiasm in the dark night of the Bengali month Kartika. Goddess Kali is worshiped here during the festival of Diwali. Thousands of oil lamps or 'diyas' are lit in her honor and in return the goddess promises renewal of life and justice on earth. A big colorful fair is also organized after the 'festival of lights' is over. This special festival of Tripura heralds happiness and prosperity in the coming year.<br><br>

<b>Garia Puja</b> It is celebrated in the autumn season. It usually falls in the months of September/October and is one of the most auspicious festivals of Tripura. It is celebrated on a grand scale with puja pandals in every nook and corner of the state. Grand festivities are celebrated over a period of four days and commemorate the defeat of the demon Mahisasur at the hands of Goddess Durga, who is also believed to be an embodiment of Shakti. The idol is immersed on the fourth day of the festival. This festival provides a unique opportunity to bring a sense of enthusiasm in the hearts of old and young people.<br><br>

<b>Orange and Tourism Festival</b> Due to the rainy season, there is an abundance of orange crop in this state. A festival is organized by the local people of the state of Tripura to mark the grand harvest. Both the tourists as well as the local people celebrate this festival with great pomp and gaiety. This grand fruit festival is celebrated every year in the month of November.<br><br>

<b>Ker Puja</b> This is another most important festival of Tripura. The Ker Puja begins about fifteen days after the Khaki Puja. The patron deity of Vastu Devta is Ker. It is a strong belief of the local people that the earlier rulers used to perform this puja for the welfare of the common people. The literal meaning of 'Ker' is a designated area, the twice-revered beliefs behind the ritualistic invocation. Those two beliefs can be summed up as the welfare of the general public against any disaster and the other includes the protection of the general from any external aggression. Sacrifice and offerings are marked features of this popular festival.<br><br>

<b>Buddha Jayanti</b> It is one of the most spectacular Buddhist festivals of Tripura. The Buddha Temple at Venuban Vihara in the city of Agartala in Tripura celebrates the festivities with great enthusiasm and vigour. This festival is celebrated every year in the month of May in Tripura and a huge fair also marks the celebration of this auspicious occasion. Buddhists across the country participate with great enthusiasm in the Buddhist Jayanti celebrations.<br><br>
