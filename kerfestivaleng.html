            Kerala, the southern state of India, is famous for its greenery and serenity of beaches as well as for its festivals. The festivals here reflect the simplicity and harmony of the people here. Kerala is a land where the festivities never end. Onam is the state festival of Kerala. Which is celebrated in different forms for about 10 days. The major Hindu festivals celebrated here are Vishu, Navratri, Deepawali, Shivaratri, Thiruvathira etc. Muslims celebrate Ramadan, Bakrid, Muharram, Milad-e-Sharif etc. Christians celebrate Christmas, Easter etc. Apart from this, different types of festivals are also celebrated in Hindu, Muslim and Christian temples.<br><br>

There is an old story behind <b>Onam</b>. Kerala was ruled by Mahabali King. People liked the king very much. People started considering him as God, so after this the gods sitting in heaven did not like it. A conspiracy was hatched. When Indra requested, Lord Vishnu incarnated as Vamana and went to King Mahabali disguised as a Brahmin. The brahmin asked for three steps of land from the king. The king was a donor, so he said that you can take this land wherever you want. After saying this, Lord Vishnu took a huge form and measured the whole earth in one step, heaven in the second step, but there was no space left for the third step. On seeing this, King Mahabali put forward his head for the third step. Now Vishnu had taken everything from Bali and asked him to go to Hades and stay there. Before going to Hades, Vishnu talked about fulfilling one of his wishes. The king said that I should be allowed to meet my subjects one day in a year, whenever the king comes after that day, the whole people celebrate and tell the king that they are happy. Singing, dancing, boat races, worship in temples, elephant races are all there. Visiting Kerala on the day of Onam is different in itself.<br><br>

<b>Aranmula Boat Race</b> is the oldest boat race in the south-western state of Kerala, India. It is organized on the occasion of Onam festival (approximately in the month of August-September) near a temple dedicated to Lord Krishna and Arjuna at a place called Aranmula. The boats move in pairs, encouraged by high-pitched songs and clamor by the spectators of the competition. In 1972, yachting was also added to the program of the festival. Thousands of spectators stand on the banks of the Pampa river to watch this snake boat competition. Forty-one snake boats, called Chundan Vallam, participated in the spardha in the year 2009. Boaters wearing white hoods and turbans sail the boat while singing traditional boat songs. The golden skirts tied on the front end of the boat, the flags and the decorated umbrellas in the middle part of the boat add to its shade.<br><br>

<b>Theyyam</b> is a grand dance festival in Kerala and is majorly celebrated in many regions of the state. Theyyams are regarded as dance deities, and are named after adding the two words 'devam' and 'atam', where 'devam' means god and 'attam' translates to dance. This dance is performed to honor the heroes and ancestral spirits. Theyyam dance is performed every year between December and April in various places in northern Malabar such as Karavalar, Kurumathoor, Nileswaram, Ezom and Cherukunnu. And it is performed every day at the Parsini Kadava Sri Muthappan Temple in Kannur. It is called ritual dance in Kerala and is also known as Kaliyattam.<br><br>

<b>Thrissur Pooram</b> is a major Hindu festival in Kerala. This grand colorful festival attracts people from all parts of Kerala. The festival is held at the Vadakkunnathan temple on the Thekkinadu Maidan mountain, in the heart of the city. It is to be known that it is celebrated on Pooram Tithi of Malayali Madam month.<br><br>

<b>Thiruvathira:</b>> Thiruvathirakali or Kaikottikali is a very popular dance form performed by the maids of Kerala. It is a group dance and is mainly celebrated on the occasion of Onam and Thiruvathira. Women or youth, whoever it is, take part in this occasion happily forgetting themselves.<br><br>
