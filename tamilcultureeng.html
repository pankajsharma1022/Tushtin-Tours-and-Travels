        <p>à¤¦All the states of South India were ruled by only Chola, Chera and Pandya dynasty. But from the fourth century onwards, only the Pallava dynasty ruled here. He was the one who started the construction of temples in Dravidian architecture.

            During the reign of King Aparajit of the last Pallava dynasty, Vijayalaya and Aditya of Chola dynasty started expanding their empire in the 10th century. In the 11th century Tamil Nadu was ruled by the Chalukya, Chola and Pandya dynasty. After this, only the Chola dynasty ruled South India for two centuries.
            
            But gradually the Muslims also tried to increase their power, due to which the Bahmani dynasty was established in the 14th century. But at the same time the Vijayanagara Empire was also growing in South India and at the end of that century there was only Vijayanagara Empire in the whole of South India. But in 1564, the Vijayanagara Empire was completely shattered due to the battle with the Sultan of Deccan at Talikota.
            
            After the battle of Talikota, the people of Europe also started showing interest in the rule of South India, due to which they too became enemies of the local king Maharaja. Shortly after this, the Portuguese, French and British came here and opened their own business centers in the name of the factory.
            In 1611, the East India Company had established the first factory in Masulipatnam, Andhra Pradesh and gradually incited the local rulers against each other and made them enemies and fought among themselves.
            
            In India, where the British started their business for the first time, the name of Tamil Nadu also has to be included. This state was earlier called as Madras Presidency in about 1901. But later the entire Madras province was made Tamil Nadu.
            
            A state like Tamil Nadu has a long history of culture. Tamil Nadu has a long history of literature, art, music and dance. Tamil Nadu is mostly famous for its ancient Hindu temples and Bharatanatyam dance. Bharatanatyam, Thanjore painting and Tamil architecture have developed a lot here and even today the people here work to keep this culture alive.</p>
