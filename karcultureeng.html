            Art and Culture of Karnataka
            Karnataka - Culture and Tradition Karnataka art
            Earlier, painting involved the whole process, not just acting,
            
            In which there was a role from seeing someone's colors to coming into their life.
            Paper, wood, cloth, etc. were some of the materials artists used as the basis for their paintings. The brushes were not made from synthetic materials but from the native hair of animals such as camels, goats and squirrels. The Mysuru style of paintings usually represents legends, mythological scenes and the royal family. This style of painting from Karnataka is known across the country for its simplicity and intricate details. The artists used a special gesso paste, consisting of zinc oxide and glue, which formed a protective layer on the paintings, which has kept them unpainted even after 150 years.
            
            Karnataka is home to 50 different tribes, each with their own traditions and customs.
            
            Tribal art is another indigenous art.
            
            Hasi Chitra clay painting is an art form originating from Shimoga and Karwar districts
            
            And it is currently being revived.</p>
