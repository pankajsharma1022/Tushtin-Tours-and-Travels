        <p>Department of Culture and Archeology
            Rajim, the operator of Chhattisgarh's glorious past, 'Kuleshwar Temple'; 'Shiva Mandir' Chandkhuri; 'Siddheshwar Temple' Palari; 'Jagannath Temple' Khallari; 'Bhoramdev Temple' Kawardha; 58 monuments have been declared as very important from the archaeological point of view, including 'Thirty-two Temples' Barsur and 'Mahamaya Temple' Ratanpur. During the last eleven years, in the last eight years, 'Culture and Archeology Department' has made continuous efforts for the protection and promotion of culture, art, literature and antiquity in Chhattisgarh. Many golden achievements have been achieved. The development of any country or region is incomplete without the development of its language. Along with the development of Chhattisgarh, the path for the development of Chhattisgarhi language has also been paved. Chhattisgarhi was given the status of official language and 'Chhattisgarh Official Language Commission' was formed, so that government work could be done in Chhattisgarh. The echo of 'Gurtur Chhattisgarhi' is being heard in the assembly.
            Kumbh Mela
            Since the passing of 'Chhattisgarh Vidhan Sabha Kumbh Mela Bill-2005' with the efforts of the Culture Minister of Chhattisgarh, the huge 'Rajim Kumbh' fair organized in 'Prayag Rajim of Chhattisgarh' has not only made its national but international identity as the fifth Kumbh. is. After 1956 in Sirpur, archaeological excavation was started again in 2006, due to which very ancient structures on 32 ancient mounds came to light. Buddhist stupas of Mauryan period were found for the first time during excavation. 79 bronze statues and one of Somvanshi ruler 'Tevardev' and three copper plates of 'Mahasiva Gupta Balarjuna' were found. Sirpur today is attracting tourists from all over the world due to its archaeological splendor. Excavation work has also been done in 'Pacharahi', 'Madkudweep', 'Maheshpur' and 'Turturiya'. Archaeological museums have been built and developed in 8 districts of Chhattisgarh.
            Cultural Center and Events
            The grand 'Purkhauti Muktangan' has been inaugurated by President 'Abdul Kalam' in Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh. Apart from this, membership of 'South Central Cultural Center' has been obtained, so that the artists of Chhattisgarh can get an opportunity to showcase their talent at national and international level. To recognize and honor the artists, 'Chhinari Program' has been started. The pension amount for artists and litterateurs has been increased from Rs 700 to Rs 1500. 'Vivekananda Prabuddha Sansthan' and 'Chhattisgarh Sindhi Sahitya Sansthan' have been formed. Along with this, grandeur has been given to the fair, Mandai and other traditional festivals in this region. In this way, Chhattisgarh, full of ancient art, culture and ancient wealth, has made its separate and unique identity on the map of India and the world, due to which the potential for development of tourism here is also limitless.
