        <p>Bengalis have always patronized literature, art, music and theater (drama). Bengali literature appeared before the 12th century. The Chaitanya movement, a condensed emotional form of Hinduism, was inspired by the medieval saint Chaitanya (1485–1533), which shaped the later development of Bengali poetry until the early 19th century. The subsequent contact with the West marked the beginning of a rapidly multifaceted creative era. The Nobel Prize winning poet Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) along with other litterateurs in the modern era, whose contribution is still in the Indian literary scene today.

    
            Theater is popular here and stage performances by newcomers as well as professional artists are of a high standard. Jatra is a traditional open theatre program, whose storyline is now clearly changing from mythological and historical themes to contemporary themes and is popular in both rural and urban cities. Kathakata is a religious chant and a traditional form of rural entertainment based on folk songs.
            
            The film industry is a modern popular means of well-established entertainment. Bengali films have won national and international awards for their excellent presentation of Indian narratives. The work of directors like Satyajit Rai, Tapan Sinha, Mrinal Sen and Aparna Sen has special significance.
            Designed by the colonial British as the grand European capital, Kolkata is now one of the poorest and most populous regions of India. It has developed into a city of extreme diversities and contradictions. Kolkata had to assimilate the intense European influence and come out of the confines of the colonial legacy to find its own identity. In the process the city became a fusion of East and West, which found expression in the works of the elite Bengalis of the 19th century. The most prominent personality of this class was the poet and mystic Rabindranath Tagore. The largest and most livable of the Indian cities, this city has flourished in the midst of seemingly insurmountable economic, social and political problems. The citizens here have shown great vibrancy, which is reflected in their interest in art and culture and a level of intellectual brilliance. The political awareness here is rare elsewhere in the country. There is no other city in India as crowded as Kolkata's book fairs, art exhibitions and music festivals are. There is a good exchange of debates on the walls, due to which Kolkata has come to be called the city of commercials.</p>
