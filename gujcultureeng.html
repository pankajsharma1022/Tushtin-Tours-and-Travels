        <p>Most of the folk culture and folklore of Gujarat is reflected in the legends associated with Lord Krishna mentioned in the Hindu religious literature Puranas. Raas dance and Rasleela performed in honor of Krishna is still prevalent in the form of the famous folk dance "Garba". This dance is performed during the Navratri festival of Goddess Durga. A folk drama Bhavai is still in existence.

            Vaishnavism has flourished in Gujarat for a long time along with Shaivism, from which Bhakti school originated. Prominent saints, poets and musicians include Narsi Mehta, author of verses in the 15th century, a 16th-century man who abandoned his palace.
            
            Garba Dance, Gujarat
            Meerabai, a Rajput princess and author of hymns, Premanand, an 18th-century poet and writer, and Dayaram, the lyricist who popularized Bhakti school. Compared to other places in India, Jainism, characterized by non-violence and vegetarianism, is deeply rooted in Gujarat. The Zoroastrians, the followers of Zarathustra, first settled on the coast of Gujarat after fleeing Persia sometime after the 17th century.
            rural woman in traditional dress
            Most of the people of this community later migrated to Bombay (present-day Mumbai). Personalities like Krishna, Dayanand Saraswati, Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel and famous cricketer Ranji made the society proud of the state. In the culture of Gujarat, mainly glass work and 'Garba' and 'Ras' dance are famous all over India. The most prominent folk dance of the state is Garba and Dandiya. In Garba dance, women dance with a perforated vessel on their head, inside which a lamp is lit. Men often participate in Dandiya but sometimes both men and women do it together. A great influence of Rajasthan can be seen on the lifestyle and dress of the state. Bhavai Loknatya is very popular in the state. The state is very rich in terms of architectural crafts. From this point of view, Rudra Mahalaya, Sidhpur, Matrimurti Pavagadh, Shilgaurav Galteshwar, Dwarkanath temple, Jain temple of Shatrunjay Palitana, Jalis of Sidi Syed Mosque, woodwork of Patan etc. are very important. The place which is of Surdas in Hindi is the same place in Gujarati as that of Narsi Mehta.

            Madhavarai fair is held at Madhavpur near Porbandar on the Navami of Shukla Paksha of Chaitra (March-April) to commemorate Lord Krishna's marriage to Rukmani.
