        <p>Despite being the least populated state of India, Sikkim is a paradise for nature lovers. Situated in the northeastern part of the country, Sikkim is surrounded by West Bengal to the south and Bhutan to its southeast, Nepal to the west and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China on its north-eastern side. Beautiful mountains, deep valleys and biodiversity make Sikkim a favorite destination for tourists. Gangtok is the capital and largest city of Sikkim and is situated at an altitude of 5500 feet on the Shivalik hills. The beautiful Kangchenjunga, which is the third highest mountain in the world, can be seen from Gangtok. The total area of ​​Sikkim is about 7000 square kilometers with a total population of 6 lakhs. Hilly in most regions, the summers in Sikkim are pleasant as the temperature never exceeds 28 degrees, while residents say the temperature dips below freezing point during winters during winters. Sikkim became a part of India in 1975 and since then, the political structure of the state follows that of the rest of the country. The Legislative Assembly consists of 32 members properly elected through elections.

            Sikkim has a rich cultural heritage, which is formed due to the combined tradition of Hinduism and Buddhism completely mixed with the Lepchas. Since Sikkimese follow Buddhism, their festivals are simpler, less packed, yet colorful. Buddhist festivals such as Drukpresi, Pang Lubasol, Saga Dawa, Losong and Dasain are widely celebrated in most places. Drinking the famous millet beer from the Himalayas gives a festive sign for special occasions such as festivals and weddings. Friends and dancing are common during such gatherings. The Sikkimese mask dance by Lamas in the courtyards of the monastery is one of the most colorful dances in Northeast India, reflecting the true essence of the culture of the place.

            Sikkim has an important political past that reflects several important events related to tribal rulership, British authority as well as the inclusion of the state as a part of India. Three tribes, the Mon, the Naong and the Chang, were used in the kingdom before the Lepcha invaded and overpowered them in the 17th century. During this time, a monarchy existed in Sikkim and the most prominent state was the Chogis who were the undisputed rulers of the state. When the British arrived in the country, the Monarch of Sikkim formed an alliance with them to fight the Nepalese and Bhutanese, who were gradually posing threats to them. With Indian independence in 1947, the state became a protectorate under India, taking on the responsibilities of defence, external relations, as well as strategic communications. However, at the time of passing, the residents of Sikkim wanted greater political freedom through democracy and therefore held five elections before 1975.
