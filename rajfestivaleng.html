            The fairs and festivals of Rajasthan come in vibrant colors in a surprisingly spectacular state, Rajasthan. Various fairs and festivals are celebrated in Rajasthan. All the fairs and festivals showcase traditional Rajasthani costumes of the state's heritage, folk songs, folk dances and various attractive competitions. The Rajasthani love for the celebration of color and joy is well reflected in the rituals and abandon with which they surrender themselves to the many festivals of the region. In fact the love for fun during festivals makes this the most colorful desert in the world. Many traditional fairs are organized after the respective festival is over. The festivals of Rajasthan are famous all over the world and marked with the greatest participation of all. The state festivals of Rajasthan are marked with more enthusiasm and fervor as religious festivals.<br><br>

<b>Teej</b> is one of the most colorful festivals of Rajasthan. The festival of Teej is dedicated to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati and is celebrated in the state of Rajasthan in the month of July or August according to the English calendar. It is mainly celebrated by the women folk of Rajasthan. Traditional songs and dances in praise of Parvati are a highlight of this grand occasion. Women folk adorn themselves in their best outfits during this occasion. In distant villages, swings are hung from trees and decorated with multicolored colors and flowers. The beautifully decorated idol of Teej Mata is taken out from the city palace in a royal procession so that the general public can pay tribute to the goddess.<br><br>

<b>Gangaur</b> is one of the most special festivals of Rajasthan and holds a special significance for Rajasthanis. During this festival young girls adorn themselves in their best outfits and seek blessings from the Goddess for the life partner of their choice. Married women on the other hand pray for the welfare of their beloved husbands. The festivities actually begin a fortnight before the actual day and the girls worship the goddess in the preceding fortnight. The festivities in the regions of Bikaner, Nathdwara, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur are full of pomp and are a must see.<br><br>

<b>Braj Holi</b> Celebrated a few days before Holi, this extraordinary Braj Holi is celebrated with devotion to Lord Krishna, dance, music and a splash of colours. It is one of the most famous fairs and festivals of Rajasthan. Locals take a dip in the ghats of river Ban Ganga before offering prayers at Radha Krishna temple.<br><br>

<b>Rajasthan International Folk Festival</b> is an annual festival held in Jodhpur since 2007. It aims to support traditional folk music and arts. It is organized every year on Sharad Purnima at Mehrangarh Fort, Jodhpur.<br><br>

<b>Desert Festival</b> is a wonderful opportunity to experience sandstones and exquisite palaces in Jaisalmer. The festivities last for 3 days- a person can experience the fancy camel journey, participate in camel races, polo matches, turban tying competitions and various other things. The greatest part about the festival is the folk dance concerts on the last day of the occasion. The major attractions of the desert carnival of Jaisalmer include snake charms, puppets, acrobats, folk artists, fire dancers and various other things.<br><br>
