        <p>The official language of Telangana is Telugu but some people say that the Telugu language spoken in Andhra Pradesh is completely different from Telangana Telugu. Some words from Sanskrit, Urdu, and English languages ​​are also spoken in Telugu language.

            Before 1948, the official language of Hyderabad was Urdu, but when Hyderabad was included in India, Telugu was made the official language of this state. Telugu medium is also taught in all the schools and colleges here.

            In the culture of Telangana, a mixture of the tradition of Persian, Moghal, Qutb Shahi and Nizam is seen. But here the influence of the culture of South India is most visible. The culture of these states is very rich. Various types of classical music, painting, Burra Katha folk dance, puppet show, Perini Shivatandavam, Gusadi dance and Kolatam are seen here.
            
            Telangana has been carved out of Andhra Pradesh, hence the state is quite small as compared to other states. Initially, when this state was created, there were very few districts in this state. But later new districts were created in this state.
            
            When new districts were created, a total of 21 new districts were created. Now a total of 31 districts are located in this state. The culture of this state is a mixture of many traditions. In this the influence of Persian, Nizam, Moghal and South Indian culture is seen.

            Telangana was carved out of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh to form a new state, which is considered as the 'South' of the South and the 'North' of the South. Hyderabad is the capital of Andhra Pradesh as well as Telangana. This dish (food) is served in steel or earthen pots called 'Kancham'. If the food is served in a banana leaf, it is called "Aarti Aaku". Dosa, Upma, Idli, Vada, Pesa Rattu, Sarva Pindi, Madugul, Chakunlu Skinalu, Urgaya Achar, Bachali Kura, Telangana Sakinalu etc. are very popular in the dishes of this.

            If we talk about dance, then the role of folk dance is important in the culture of Telangana. The ancient dance form of this is Perini Thandavan, which has been revived in recent times. It originated and prospered in Telangana during the Kakatiya dynasty. It is a dance usually performed by men. It is also called 'Dance of Warriors'. Before going to the battlefield, the warriors enact this dance before the idol of Lord Shiva. This dance is believed to invoke 'Prerna' and is dedicated to the supreme dancer, Lord Shiva.
            
            In the Bonalu festival in Telangana region, all women wear colorful clothes and worship the village goddess Mahakali, along with a lot of dancing and singing. The festival called Bathukamma or Thumbalam is also celebrated by women with great pomp. In this festival, everyone worships Mata Guri and pleases her.
