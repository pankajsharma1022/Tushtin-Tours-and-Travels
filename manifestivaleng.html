            The state of Manipur can be defined as the land of celebration. All the festivals in the state of Manipur are celebrated with great enthusiasm and enthusiasm. The festivals of Manipur are a tribute to the rich culture and heritage of the state. In fact the festivals of Manipur are a symbol of their cultural, social and religious aspirations. The festivals of this state are deeply rooted in Hindu mythology and age-old cultural traditions. The celebration of festivals is not only meant for unrestrained tinkering, but also exposes the whole of humanity to the stereotypes of a progressive social order within its conservative and time-honored framework. The multi-coloured festivals of this state also remove the monotony of daily life by providing mental entertainment, physical variety and emotional outlet.<br><br>

<b>The Kut festival</b> is celebrated with equal fervor and enthusiasm in all the districts of Manipur and is considered as one of the most desired festivals of Manipur. It is generally considered to be a pot-harvest festival celebrated during the autumn months on 1 November every year. It is also celebrated keeping in mind the cause of social welfare, i.e. promoting communal harmony, love and peaceful coexistence within all communities. This festival is described as Chawang-kut or Khodo etc. at different places among different tribes. The festival actually commemorates a bountiful harvest after a year of hard labor and invokes the festival of thanksgiving, traditional songs and unrestrained antelope in the form.<br><br>

<b>Kang (Ratha Jatra)</b> is one of the very important festivals celebrated by Hindus in the state of Manipur. This hugely popular festival is celebrated by the people of Manipur for ten days in the month of Injen or in the month of June/July. It is believed by the locals that Lord Jagannath visits the temple locally known as 'Kanga', which is drawn by pilgrims, who accompany others for this honour.<br><br>

<b>Yaoshang</b> is one of the important festivals of Manipur. The festival is celebrated for five days starting from the full moon date of Falgun month or the months of February/March. It is indeed one of the major festivals of Manipur. Both male and female folk participate in various cultural performances, especially the Thabal Chongba dance to forget the sorrows of their lives. Both young and old collect donations from each household and then spend them all in community parties and feasts. Various sports and games meetings are also organized to enhance the festive spirit of the festival.<br><br>

<b>The Lai-Haroba festival</b> represents the worship of traditional deities and ancestors and is one of the most joyous festivals of Manipur. It is indeed the most exquisite and colorful of the Manipuris. This festival is a splendid combination of religious singing, traditional songs and dances. It is observed by the people of Manipur in the month of May in honor of the local deity Umang Thai. This much awaited festival of Manipur celebrates the process of creation and twelve events show the stages of creation. This festival is also the ripe time to dance the Lion, which signifies the birth of the Lord.<br><br>

<b>Kwak Yatra (Dussehra)</b> is a very special festival of Manipuris and is celebrated during the months of September/October. In this grand festival, Goddess Durga is pleased with great enthusiasm.<br><br>

<b>Chumpha</b> is one of the most special festivals of Manipur and it is celebrated every year for a period of seven days after the December harvest. It is the Tangahul Nagas who celebrate this festival with much pomp and show. The role played by women in this Manipuri festival is remarkable. Social gatherings are organized during the last three days of the festival, where family and friends are cordially invited to indulge themselves to the fullest.<br><br>
