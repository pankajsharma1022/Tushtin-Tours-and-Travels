        <p>The cultural life of Maharashtra is a mixture of influences from ancient Indian culture, civilization and historical events. The development of Marathi language and Marathi literature is an expression of the cultural identity of Maharashtra. Devotion to local and regional deities, teachings of saint poets like Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram and respect for Chhatrapati Shivaji and other political and social leaders are the special hallmarks of the culture of Maharashtra. Devotees from far and wide visit Kolhapur, Tuljapur, Pandharpur, Nashik, Akola, Phaltan, Ambejogai and Chiplun and other religious places. The importance of fairs and festivals is also no less. Ganesh Chaturthi, Ram Navami, other local and regional fairs and festivals hold an important place in the cultural life of Maharashtra. Through these, there is local and regional reconciliation of people and they promote social unity. People also participate in large numbers in the festivals of the blind religions, which reflects the cosmopolitan character of the cultural life. Cultural life has got a new dimension with the 'Mahanubhav Mat' and Buddhism revived by Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar.

            Stage
            Theater received special attention in Maharashtra in the 1990s; Playwrights like V. Khadilkar and Vijay Tendulkar and artists like Balgandharva established Marathi drama as an art form. The credit for the beginning of India's film industry goes to pioneers like Dadasaheb Phalke and Baburao Painter. The Prabhat Film Company of Pune became famous for the production of Sant Tukaram and Dnyaneshwar. Marathi actors like Nana Patekar and Madhuri Dixit have been particularly successful in Hindi cinema. Like Marathi literature, Maharashtra also has an ancient tradition of music. Around the 14th century, it coincided with Indian music. In the modern period, Pandit Paluskar and Pandit Bhatkhande gave a new direction to Indian classical music. The role of other players like Vilayat Hussain, Alla Rakha is also no less important. Today singers like Pandit Bhimsen Joshi and Lata Mangeshkar represent an important role of music in the cultural life of Maharashtra. Maharashtra also has an ancient tradition of art, which can be seen in the designs of Ajanta and Ellora caves, textiles, gold and silver jewellery, wooden toys, leather goods and pottery.
            
            The Sir JJ School of Art, established in 1833, was the first modern institution in the field of art education. Now most of the towns and big cities of Maharashtra have art institutes. Classical dance forms have attracted talent and their training schools are flourishing in big cities like Pune. Folktales consisting of music, drama and dance such as Lavani (romantic song), Povada (vigorous dance) and Tamasha have been revived. The Directorate of Arts and Films and the Board of Literature and Culture are reflective of the keen interest of the State Government. The influence of Maharashtra's culture has spread beyond Maharashtra as well. The capitals of the erstwhile Maratha Empire, such as Baroda (now Vadodara), Gwalior and other cities in Maharashtra play an active role in this.
