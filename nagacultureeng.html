The Naga people are one of the Indo-Mongol tribes. These people are located in areas adjoining the north-eastern hills and upper reaches of western Myanmar. The tribals of Nagaland live in the areas mostly follow Christianity and Nagaland is also considered as the most Baptist state in the world.

            If we talk about the language, the language of Naga Uz is different from each other, due to the difference in mutual communication, English plays the main role for this and English is the official language of Nagaland and it is most spoken in Nagaland Local of Nagaland Languages ​​are classified in the Tibet-Burma language family.
            
        
             
            Culture of Nagaland - Talking about Nagaland, now we have come to the culture of Nagaland in Hindi, where it is as beautiful as it is full of natural beauty, inhabited in the green valleys, the culture here has a deep relationship with nature for centuries. It has been and will be since, it seems that nature has decorated it with her own hands, that is why it is called "Switzerland of the East" because here it is scattered all around and the tribes of Nagaland wear their traditional costumes showing the valor of their ancestors. It seems that there is a lot of enthusiasm in the festival of Naga people, it shows the art of living here.
            The younger generation of Nagaland has changed with time but they take pride in their ancient culture and celebrate the festival in a traditional way. It is known that the first right on property belongs to women.
            Nagaland seems to be more influential than western culture, here you will see more Hollywood craze than Bollywood and it will also be visible in modern clothes
            As much as the ancient culture in Nagaland is different from other North Indian states, the modern culture is also different.</p>
